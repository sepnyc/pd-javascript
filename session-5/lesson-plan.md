# Session 5: JavaScript and the Web

Lesson Plan for JavaScript Professional Development

##### Learning Outcomes

- Write JavaScript that changes a web page.
- Render content to a user interface (UI) in HTML with JavaScript.
- Delay code execution in the browser.
- Explain the purposes of and differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Transfer code from files into a web-based editor (like JS Bin).

In this lesson, we'll begin exploring how to integrate JavaScript into a web page. We'll see how JavaScript can be used in a browser to manipulate the elements on the page, respond to user input, render text, and set "timeouts" for delayed execution.

##### Concepts

- browser environment
- rendering
- time-delays

##### Outline

- Introduction & Review (30 min)
- Use JavaScript in an HTML page (110 min)
- Wrap-up (10 min)

## Morning Lesson

Total time: ~2.5 hours

### Introduction & Review (30 min)
- Warm up: review last session (20 min)
  1. Work in pairs or groups of three
  1. Open up project code ([session-4/makeGame-rachel.js](../session-4/makeGame-rachel.js))
  1. Go through the file and run the code in your "brain simulators"
  1. Take note of places in the code where you have questions
  1. After 10 min, come back together and discuss questions
- Introduction: JavaScript in the Browser (10 min)
  - Discuss questions: what is HTML? what is CSS? how does a browser "read" them?
    - Analogy: browsers vs. word processor programs (content = HTML, styles = CSS)
  - Discuss questions: what is the role of JavaScript in relation to HTML and CSS? how does a browser "read" a JavaScript file?
    - Analogy: browsers vs. spreadsheet programs (formulas = JS)

### Use JavaScript in an HTML page (110 min)
- Complete the `magicStick` exercise
  1. Load the page [session-5/magicStick/page.html](./magicStick/page.html) into a new JS Bin
  1. Complete each task in the comments (in order)

### Wrap-up (10 min)
- What was important?
- What was useful?
- What can we do better next time?
