# Session 3: Practical Programming in JavaScript

Lesson Plan for JavaScript Professional Development

##### Learning Outcomes

- Create and execute small programs using JavaScript
- Be able to debug code using basic debugging tools and techniques
- Develop good habits for iterative program development

##### Concepts

- testing
- debugging
- interface
- data structures
- iterative development

##### Outline

<!-- TODO: complete outline -->

- Introduction
- Define project for the day: grade calculator (input series of grades, calculate average with letter grade)
- Work through project together in small steps, discussing errors as they arise
- Conclusion, final questions

## Morning Lesson

Total time: ~2.5 hours  
Presentation: slides | [source file](slides.md)

The presentation is designed to cover the full scope of the session. It provides most of the prompts needed to run this session, with the below serving as notes for the instructor.

- Introduction & Review (20 min)
- Project (60 min)
  - Setup: rotate pairs
    - Open both JavaScript and Console tab in JS Bin
  - Define project purpose: grading calculator
  - Identify development process: building a simple program and then slowly making it more complex
  - Go through 10-min development cycles
    - Define goal for cycle (write test for goal)
    - Teachers code in pairs to solve goal
    - Re-group and show example solutions (in [project](project/) directory)
- Reflection & Discussion (60 min)
- Wrap-up (10 min)
  - Go over post-session questions as group
  - Request feedback, suggestions for future sessions
  - Remind teachers about [list of learning resources](../README.md#resources)
