##### Outline

- Morning Lesson
  - Introduction & Review (10 min)
  - Programming Essentials: Arrays (10 min)
  - Development Process Discussion (20 min)
  - Project Definition (20 min)
  - Group Development (60 min)
  - Project Reflection (20 min)
  - Wrap-up (10 min)
- Afternoon Project
  - Define project for the day: grade calculator (input series of grades, calculate average with letter grade)
  - Work through project together in small steps, discussing errors as they arise
  - Conclusion, final questions

## Morning Lesson

Total time: ~2.5 hours  
Presentation: slides | [source file](slides.md)

The presentation is designed to cover the full scope of the session. It provides most of the prompts needed to run this session, with the below serving as notes for the instructor.

- Introduction & Review (20 min)
  - Functions
  - Control Flow
  - Iteration
- Programming Essentials: Arrays (10 min)
  - What is an array?
  - Besides iteration, how can we interact with it?
- Development Process Discussion (20 min)
  - Defining the problem
  - Setting goals
  - Separating versions, simplify as much as possible
  - Clarifying use (interface)
  - Write expectations (testing)
  - Write code to pass tests
- Project Definition (20 min)
  - Open JSBin JS and Console, write in comments
  - Project: attendance taker
  - What is the goal?
    - (list students, ask for "present", store attendance)
  - What is the simplest solution?
  - What is the interface?
  - What is the first test we can write?
    - Write this test
- Group Development (60 min)
  - Start a group development cycle:
    - Get a volunteer to solve the test
    - Get a volunteer to write the next test
    - Repeat
  - When a bug appears, use debugging techniques:
    - Is there an error?
      - If so, what line is it on?
      - What is the program state when the error occurs?
    - What is the expected result?
    - What is the actual result?
    - How can we isolate and reproduce the error?
    - What is our hypothesis for fixing it?
    - How can we conduct an experiment to remedy the error?
- Project Reflection (20 min)
  - Was this process similar to other learning or working processes you use?
  - What was new and different about it?
  - What did we learn?
  - What did we build?
- Wrap-up (10 min)
  - Go over post-session questions as group
  - Request feedback, suggestions for future sessions
  - Remind teachers about [list of learning resources](../README.md#resources)

## Afternoon Project

- Setup: work in pairs
  - Open both JavaScript and Console tab in JS Bin
- Define project purpose: grading calculator
- Use pair development process
  - Build a simple program and then slowly make it more complex
- Go through 15-min development cycles
  - Define goal for cycle (write test for goal)
  - Teachers code in pairs to solve goal
  - Re-group and show example solutions (in [project](project/) directory)
