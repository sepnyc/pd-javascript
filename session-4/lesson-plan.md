# Session 4: Working with Objects

Lesson Plan for JavaScript Professional Development

##### Learning Outcomes

- Model concepts as objects that encapsulate behavior and state
- Utilize the `this` keyword to represent the object-in-context
- Differentiate between index-based and key-value storage
- Separate logic layer from view/interaction layer

##### Concepts

- encapsulation
- index-based store
- key-value store
- properties
- methods

##### Outline

- Morning Lesson
  - Introduction & Review (10 min)
  - Pedagogical Technique: JIT Knowledge (10 min)
  - Collaborative Coding on Project (120 min)
  - Wrap-up (10 min)
- Afternoon Project

## Morning Lesson

- Introduction & Review
  - Discuss goals, outcomes for the day
  - Go over concepts from past 3 sessions
- Pedagogical Technique: JIT Knowledge
  - Outline what JIT is and how it will work today
- Collaborative Coding on Project
  - Define project for the day
    - Specifications for final product
    - Connection to outcomes, concepts
  - Use starter code to begin development
  - Work to build out the game in iterative stages
    - Use volunteers to build features
    - Before each feature:
      - Define task
      - Provide context
      - Provide information needed for success
    - After each feature:
      - Reflect on meaning and utility of information
      - Expand and adapt information to other contexts
- Wrap-up
  - Compare group result code with example solution code

Total time: ~2.5 hours

## Afternoon Project

With participants, decide on one of two options:

1. Design, model, and code a game or small application together
2. Continue building on the morning project using JIT style
