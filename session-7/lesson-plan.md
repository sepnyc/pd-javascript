# Session 7: Designing Projects for the Classroom

Lesson Plan for JavaScript Professional Development

##### Outline

- Morning Lesson
  - Introduction (10 min)
  - Final Team Project
  - Wrap-up (10 min)
- Afternoon Project

## Morning Lesson

Total time: ~2.5 hours

In pairs, work through the [mysounds](mysounds/) tutorial.

After each step, share solutions as a group.

## Afternoon Workshop

Project Design

- define learning outcomes
- decide: project, exercises, lab, ? what format is best
- brainstorm project options
- decide on project that meets criteria of:
  - interesting/meaningful to students
  - can be completed using the goal knowledge, and doesn't require more
    - stays on topic
  - is scoped to the time available
- what are the completion options?
  - what is the minimal completion?
  - what differentiated outcomes can be used?
    - must stay w/in topic
- what are the start conditions?
  - scaffolding: provide enough code to get students started and gaining momentum from step 1
  - ensure that learners spend time understanding context
  - give them an immediate and simple way to verify/test their code
    - need to establish feedback loops
- what are the specs for the final project?
  - expressed as: tests, plain specs, user stories, an example solution (i.e. HTML gif) - Codeunion example?
- decide on progression style:
  - additive (each step builds off of the last one, producing ever-better products) - easiest to design
  - subtractive (give them a bunch of bad code, tell them to refactor and/or debug the code) - most up-front work to design
  - organic (each step produces a functional product, but may involve removing/editing earlier code) - most complex progression, also most realistic (to problem-solving patterns)
- what are the various steps?
  - some other names for them: versions, objectives, stories, epics
  - based on progression style, find natural fission points in
